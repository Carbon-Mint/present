## Types of Data Captured

* Practices
  * e.g. what kind of fertilizer, and how it's applied
* Costs
  * e.g. Inputs, labor, equipment, etc.
* Impact
  * e.g. Water usage, soil carbon levels

All data tagged with geolocation, user id and timestamp

## Continuous Carbon Mapping (1/2)

![continuous-mapping](mint/images/timelines.png)

---
## Continuous Carbon Mapping (2/2)

* All activity is mapped to carbon offsets (+/-)
  * Examples:
  * Solar energy (+)
  * Chemical fertilizer (-)
  * Composted Manure (+)
  * Raw Manure (-)

* Token rewards based on estimates

## Tokenization

```
Plan -> Execute -> Certify ->  Align -> Tokenize
         |            |          |         |

       Measure
       Practice     Audit      Audit     Realize
       Capture     (System)   (Carbon)
